# RainbowNametag
A plugin I made for fun, gives you a rainbow name-tag in game.

# Commands
```yaml
commands:
  nametag:
    aliases: ["rainbow", "rainbownametags"]
    description: Starts, or stops the rainbow nametag above your head and in tab!
```

# Permissions
`rainbow.command.nametag` - Gives you full access to the `/nametag` commands.

# Information
You can add this to an existing plugin if you have one, if you're redistributing it, please let me know via `GrowlyX#1337` on discord.
